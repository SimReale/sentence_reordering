# Sentence Reordering
This is the project made for the *Deep Learning (DL)* exam of the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bologna. 
It is about realizing a Neural Network with some limited constraints in terms of parameters to address the **Sentence Reordering** task.
Any instruction on how to realize the project is in the notebook, so check out if you're interested.

Enjoy!
